## Master Project : Designing a Course Unit on Large Language Models (LLMs)
Abstract
This project focuses on the development of a comprehensive course unit dedicated to Large Language Models (LLMs) for advanced under- graduate students. Recognizing the pivotal role of LLMs in AI, the course aims to impart a fundamental understanding of LLMs and pro- vide hands-on experience with their applica- tions. The course design is tailored to fit within the constraints of lecture volume and prereq- uisite knowledge. It includes lectures, written assignments, and a project involving Pytorch, facilitating an intuitive understanding of LLMs. Future enhancements include identifying an op- timal prerequisite for student preparation and addressing the practicality of the project format to the availability of computational resources.
